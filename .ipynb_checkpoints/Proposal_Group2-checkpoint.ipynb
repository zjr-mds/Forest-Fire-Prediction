    "We expect to find that this model will have the ability to predict the existence of future forest fires with an accuracy above 85%, based on the FWI, FFMC, BUI, and ISI of the region. This prediction model can be applied proactively as a means to prevent future forest fires in vulnerable regions, thus making it a valuable environmental tool. \n",
